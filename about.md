☕️ cybersecurity student<br>

<p>Yahallo!! my name is aryan aka xohan30. I am a cybersecurity student/hacker/researcher
and sometimes i become a programmer too. I am currently at my freshman year pursuing my B.Tech degree in
cybersecurity and forrensics. I have always been fascinated towards the world of internet and hacking
from a very young age. I used to go onto my computer and click some codes in that cmd terminal or just write some
bat codes in the notepad to automate stuffs and oh god i really felt like a hacker. As i grew up i actually started 
to understand the methodology behind hacking and the working of systems. I got more focused in the field and i started
working on my skills day and night and here i am now. On a journey to make my passion and hardwork into living.</p>

_"they say that hacking is not a job or a profession but its an art or a way of living life"_

<p>Next i would like to thank both of my parents for being such a supportive one and letting me chase my dream
to the fullest.</p>
