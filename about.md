☕️ cybersecurity student<br>

<p>Yahallo!! my name is aryan aka xohan30. I am a cybersecurity student/hacker/researcher
and sometimes i become a programmer too. I am currently at my freshman year pursuing B.Tech degree in
cybersecurity and forensics. I have always been fascinated towards the world of internet and hacking
from a very young age. I used to go onto my computer and click some codes in that cmd terminal or just write some
bat scripts in notepad to automate stuffs and oh god i really felt like a hacker. As i grew up i actually started 
to understand the methodology and mindset behind hacking and the working of systems. I got more focused in the field and i started
working on my skills day and night and here i am now chasing my dream of becoming a talented hacker and give back towrds the community 
for everything they have tought me in life.</p>

_"they say that hacking is not a job or a profession but its an art or a way of living life"_

<p>And lastly i would like to thank both of my parents for being such a supportive one by letting me get into the field of hacking.
AHH and apart from hacking i like eating good food(vegetarian), building cool projects, drinking coffee and watching anime.
